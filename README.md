# Playwright Bing Maps Testing Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Playwright Bing Maps Testing Project** - a specialized open-source initiative designed for experienced developers and testers seeking to leverage the capabilities of Playwright for comprehensive and precise testing of web applications, with a specific focus on "Microsoft Bing Maps." In this project, we are determined to address the relative scarcity of open-source automated testing solutions tailored to mapping applications. We have chosen Playwright as our testing framework for its exceptional aptitude in handling dynamic content inherent to maps.

## Project Scope and Objectives

### Scope

This project extends beyond mere end-to-end (E2E) testing and encompasses a broader vision:

- **E2E Testing**: Develop a robust and scalable suite of E2E test cases to validate various aspects of Microsoft Bing Maps functionality.

- **API Automation**: Incorporate automated API testing capabilities to ensure a holistic assessment of both frontend and backend components.

### Objectives

1. **Dynamic Map Validation**: Our foremost objective is to establish efficient and reliable validation mechanisms to confirm that location searches render the desired results on the map.

2. **Comprehensive Testing**: We aspire to construct an exhaustive testing suite that explores various real-world scenarios and intricacies of Microsoft Bing Maps.

3. **API Testing Integration**: Integration of automated API testing will enable rigorous examination of backend services, bolstering the overall testing coverage.
